    "\n",
    "Quantum computing is a theory of computing that uses quantum-mechanics, such as **superposition and entanglement**, to perform computational operations. It has the potential to solve certain problems much faster than classical computers, due to the principles of quantum mechanics allowing quantum computers to execute certain calculations simultaneously."
